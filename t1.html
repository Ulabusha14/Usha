1. Pitch and field: The game is played on a grass field called the pitch, which is a rectangular 
strip in the center. At each end of the pitch, there is a set of three wooden stumps,
 with two bails placed on top. The field surrounding the pitch is known as the outfield.
2. Innings: A cricket match consists of two innings, one for each team. 
During an inning, one team bats while the other team bowls and fields.
Each team gets a turn to bat and bowl.
3. Batting: The batting team sends two batsmen onto the pitch,
and they try to score runs by hitting the ball with their bats 
and running between the wickets. The main objective for the batsmen
is to score runs and avoid getting out.
4. Bowling: The bowling team has bowlers who deliver the ball towards
the batsman with the aim of getting them out or restricting the number 
of runs scored. The bowlers can use various techniques to try and deceive
the batsmen, such as spin, swing, and pace.
5. Fielding: The fielding team tries to prevent the batting team from scoring
runs and dismiss their batsmen by catching the ball or running them out. 
Fielders are positioned strategically around the field to cover different areas.
6. Scoring runs: Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. 
They can also score runs by hitting boundaries, which can either be four runs if the ball 
crosses the boundary on the ground or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without bouncing.
